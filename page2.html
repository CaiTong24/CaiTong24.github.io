Dong Young-bae (Hangul: 동영배; born 18 May 1988),better known by his stage name Taeyang (meaning sun in Korean), is a South Korean singer-songwriter. After appearing in Jinusean's music video "A-yo," Taeyang began training under YG Entertainment at the age of 12. After six years of training, he made his debut in 2006 as a member of the South Korean boy band Big Bang.

In 2008, Taeyang began pursuing a solo career, releasing his first extended play Hot in 2008 followed by his first full length studio album Solar in 2010. His second studio album Rise (2014) peaked at number 112 on the US Billboard 200 Chart, becoming the highest ranking album by a Korean soloist to enter the chart while its single "Eyes, Nose, Lips" peaked at number one on Billboard K-pop Hot 100 Chart, giving him his first solo number one single on that chart.
