            In 2012, G-Dragon built a pension motel as a gift to his family; fans can also stay at this hotel which is now run as a business by his parents. In October 20, 2015, G-Dragon opened officially his first Cafe, under the name of "Monsant Cafe". The café is located on Jeju Island. The South Korean indie band Hyukoh was the first artist to play at the café in September 2015.
